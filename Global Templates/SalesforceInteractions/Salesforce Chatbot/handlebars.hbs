Global Template: Salesforce Chatbot

This global template interacts with the Salesforce Chatbot that is embedded on your website.

There are two different triggers for the chatbot: time on page and inactivity.

Requirements:
1) The chatbot needs to be embedded on your website.
See https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bot_cookbook.meta/bot_cookbook/bot_cookbook_first_bot.htm
2) At least one available content zone.

Customizations:
1) As a best practice, set the content zone to "global_chatbot".
See https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/personalization/guide/content-zones for recommended names for
content zones
mapped via the Sitemap.
2) This template is set up with two configurable Trigger Options for the chatbot in the Serverside Code.
3) While this template only tracks impressions, it is worth considering adding tracking for clickthrough and dismissal
stats. Should you decided to add additional tracking, the following docs will be helpful to reference:
