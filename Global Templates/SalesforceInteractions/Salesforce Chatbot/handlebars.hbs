    Global Template: Salesforce Chatbot

    This global template interacts with the Salesforce Chatbot that is embedded on your website.

    There are two different triggers for the chatbot: time on page and inactivity.

    Requirements:
    1) The chatbot needs to be embedded on your website.
    See https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bot_cookbook.meta/bot_cookbook/bot_cookbook_first_bot.htm
    2) At least one available content zone.

    Customizations:
    1) As a best practice, set the content zone to "global_chatbot".
    See https://developer.evergage.com/web-integration/sitemap/contentzones for recommended names for content zones
    mapped via the Sitemap.
    2) This template is set up with two configurable Trigger Options for the chatbot in the Serverside Code.
    3) While this template only tracks impressions, it is worth considering adding tracking for clickthrough and dismissal
    stats. Should you decided to add additional tracking, the following docs will be helpful to reference:
