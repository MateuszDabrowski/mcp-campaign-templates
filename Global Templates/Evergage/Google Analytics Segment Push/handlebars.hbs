    Global Template: Google Analytics Segment Push

    This global template lets you push one or more segments to the specified Google Analytics dimensions.
    Any and all segments that match user membership will be set to the Google Analytics dimension provided.
    When a user matches more than one segment, the segment names will be concatenated into one pipe (|)
    delimited string (e.g. "Segment 1|Segment 2|Segment 3").

    Note that the template is built to work with the analytics.js tag (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs).
    If you are using a different tag from Google Analytics, then you will likely need to make adjustments
    to the Clientside Code.

    Requirements:
    1) Ensure that the desired segments are available in the dataset.

    Customizations:
    1) Reconfigure the Google Analytics send method in Clientside Code as necessary.
    2) Change the delimiter character from pipe ("|") to whatever is needed in Clientside Code.
