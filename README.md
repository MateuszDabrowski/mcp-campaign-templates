# MC Personalization Campaign Templates

This repository is split into two separate sections:

## 1. Custom Templates

This folder (will) contain my own templates showcasing various tricks you can leverage in building your camapigns as an extension of my [MCP Campaign Templating documentation](https://mateuszdabrowski.pl/docs/category/serverside-code/).

## 2. Global Templates

This folder contains fork of official Global Templates for archiving and inspiration purposes.

It's a permitted direct copy of the [Evergage](https://github.com/MateuszDabrowski/mcp-campaign-templates/tree/main/Global%20Templates/Evergage) / [Salesforce](https://github.com/MateuszDabrowski/mcp-campaign-templates/tree/main/Global%20Templates/SalesforceInteractions) code but it is not maintained in any way by Salesforce.
