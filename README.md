# MC Personalization Campaign Templates

This repository is split into two separate sections:

## 1. Custom Templates

This folder (will) contain my own templates showcasing various tricks you can leverage in building your camapigns as an extension of my [MCP Campaign Templating documentation](https://mateuszdabrowski.pl/docs/category/serverside-code/).

## 2. Global Templates

This folder contains fork of official Global Templates for archiving and inspiration purposes.

It's a permitted direct copy of the [Evergage](https://github.com/MateuszDabrowski/mcp-campaign-templates/tree/main/Global%20Templates/Evergage)/[Salesforce](https://github.com/MateuszDabrowski/mcp-campaign-templates/tree/main/Global%20Templates/SalesforceInteractions) code but it is not maintained in any way by Salesforce.

__HELP NEEDED!__

Evergage subfolder currently has only few templates that I was able to recover from the no-longer-existing [evergage-global-template](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fI8eDGQsyggJ:https://github.com/evergage/evergage-global-templates/tree/master/banner-with-cta&hl=en&gl=pl) repository. If you have some other unchanged official global templates in that namespace, I would love to add them here.
